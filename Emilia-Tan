    <h2>Why I like "Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World and The Frozen Bond</h2>
    <p class="custom-paragraph">
       I love the series because of the interesting plot and a character, Emilia. Emilia had to go through so much hardship, but she never yielded, she continued to help others just to make a friend, even to people who want to harm her, she is the true and only angel in my heart.

However, despite all the hatred, she remained kind, dilligent, and temperant, often mapping the parlous Elior forest so nobody will get lost. She also forgives and even risks her life to save people who tried to harm her.
